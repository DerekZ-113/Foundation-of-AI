## Artificial Intelligence
AI is the study of how machines can **think, act, learn, and solve problems**. There are multiple approaches to defining AI:

### Core Abilities of AI:
1. **Thinking**
2. **Action (Making decisions)**
3. **Having knowledge**
4. **Problem-solving**
5. **Learning**

## Defining AI: Four Approaches
AI can be categorized based on whether it **thinks or acts** and whether it does so **humanely or rationally**:

### 1. Thinking Humanly *(Cognitive Modeling Approach)*
- AI should mimic human thought processes.
- Requires observing human reasoning, cognitive modeling, and brain scans.

### 2. Thinking Rationally *(Laws of Thought Approach)*
- AI should follow logical rules and reason correctly.
- Based on mathematical logic.

### 3. Acting Humanly *(The Turing Test Approach)*
- AI should behave in ways indistinguishable from human intelligence.
- Emphasizes **natural language processing, knowledge representation, automated reasoning, and machine learning**.

### 4. Acting Rationally *(Rational Agent Approach)*
- AI should **achieve the best possible outcome** or maximize performance given available information.
- Focuses on making **optimal decisions** rather than imitating humans.

## Problem Solving in AI
AI must be able to solve problems by reasoning and searching for solutions efficiently. Key areas include:

### 1. Search Problems
- AI systems often explore many possible solutions before selecting the best one.
- Example: Finding the shortest path in a navigation system.

### 2. Adversarial Games
- AI must make strategic decisions in environments where opponents also make decisions (e.g., Chess, Go).

### 3. Constraints in AI Problems
- AI must operate under **limited resources** (e.g., time, memory, computing power).

### 4. Uncertainty in AI
- AI must deal with **incomplete or noisy data**.
- Example: Speech recognition systems must handle accents and background noise.

### 5. Machine Learning *(Learning and Adaptation)*
- AI should **adjust and improve** based on experience.
- Example: Recommendation systems (Netflix, Spotify) learn from user preferences.

### 6. Language Processing *(NLP - Natural Language Processing)*
- AI should be able to **understand and generate human language**.
- Example: Chatbots, translation systems (Google Translate).

## Agents and Rational Behavior
In AI, an **agent** is any entity that perceives its environment through **sensors** and acts upon it using **actuators**.

### Types of AI Agents:
1. **Simple Reflex Agents**: Act only based on current perceptions.
2. **Model-Based Agents**: Maintain some memory of past events to make better decisions.
3. **Goal-Based Agents**: Plan future actions based on a goal.
4. **Utility-Based Agents**: Optimize actions based on a numerical utility function.
5. **Learning Agents**: Improve performance over time by learning from experience.
